# Notes

These two scripts check if the local builtin administrator account is enabled [detect.ps1](remediate.ps1).
If it's not enabled, you can execute [remediate.ps1](remediate.ps1) to enable the account.

## Planned usage

For use as an Intune "remediation" with a detection and an actual remediation script.
